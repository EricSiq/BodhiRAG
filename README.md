### Guidelines for Sourcing Datasets for the NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2025

The core of a successful NASA Space Apps project is the effective use of **open data from NASA and its partners**. While the specific challenges for the 2025 hackathon will be announced closer to the event, the general guidelines for dataset sourcing remain consistent.

### Key Guidelines for Dataset Sourcing

1.  **Prioritize Official Data Sources:** The primary objective is to use data provided by NASA and its international partners. You should focus on datasets and APIs from the following:
    * **NASA's Open Data Portal:** This is the main hub for NASA's publicly available datasets, covering a wide range of topics from Earth science to planetary exploration.
    * **NASA APIs:** The [api.nasa.gov](http://api.nasa.gov) site offers a catalog of APIs, including the popular Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), Mars Rover Photos, and others related to near-Earth objects and space weather.
    * **NASA Earthdata:** This portal provides a vast collection of Earth observation data, with tools for searching, visualizing, and downloading datasets from satellites like Landsat and MODIS.
    * **International Space Agency Partners:** The hackathon often features challenges with data from partners like the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the European Space Agency (ESA). Check the official challenge descriptions for links to their respective data portals.
2.  **Use Provided Resources:** The official hackathon website will have a dedicated section for "Resources" or "Data" specific to each challenge. These resources are vetted by NASA and are the most direct and relevant sources for your project. Always check here first.
3.  **Adhere to Licensing and Terms of Use:** All NASA data is open and publicly available, but it's important to respect any specific terms of use. In general, NASA data is not subject to copyright in the United States, but proper attribution is always a good practice.
4.  **Avoid Unofficial or Proprietary Data (unless specified):** While you can use other data sources to supplement your project, the core of your solution should rely on NASA's open data. Solutions that depend on proprietary or closed-source data may not be considered for global awards.
5.  **Data Curation is Part of the Challenge:** A key part of the hackathon is finding and making sense of the data. Don't expect a single, perfectly formatted CSV file. Your team may need to write scripts to parse data from APIs, clean up datasets, and merge different sources to get the information you need.

### Potential Problem Statements Using NASA POWER and Other APIs

The NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project provides solar, meteorological, and surface meteorology data. This data is invaluable for projects related to renewable energy, agriculture, and climate. Here are some potential problem statements based on the POWER dataset and other relevant NASA APIs.

#### Problem Statement 1: Renewable Energy Optimization for Off-Grid Communities üè°üí°

**Description:** Develop a tool or application that helps off-grid communities (like remote villages or disaster relief camps) optimize their renewable energy systems. The solution should use historical and forecast solar and meteorological data from the **NASA POWER API** to determine the optimal size and configuration of a solar panel and battery system.

**Required Data/APIs:**
* **NASA POWER API:** For solar radiation (e.g., all-sky insolation, clear sky insolation), temperature, wind speed, and other meteorological parameters.
* **NASA Worldview API:** To visualize the location and local weather patterns.
* **Geospatial Data:** Use other open-source geospatial data to map remote community locations and potential infrastructure.

#### Problem Statement 2: Predicting and Mitigating Drought for Smart Agriculture üåæüíß

**Description:** Create a predictive model that forecasts drought conditions and their impact on agricultural yields in specific regions. The application should combine climate data with satellite imagery to provide actionable insights for farmers and policymakers, helping them implement water conservation strategies before a drought strikes.

**Required Data/APIs:**
* **NASA POWER API:** For historical precipitation, temperature, and humidity data.
* **NASA Earthdata:** Datasets from satellites like the **Landsat series** or **MODIS** for vegetation health indices (e.g., NDVI).
* **NASA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) API:** For real-time and historical precipitation data. 

#### Problem Statement 3: Enhancing Urban Planning with Micro-Climate Analysis üèôÔ∏èüå°Ô∏è

**Description:** Build a data-driven tool for urban planners to identify "heat islands" and model the effects of different mitigation strategies (e.g., green roofs, tree planting) on urban temperatures. The tool would use high-resolution climate data and geospatial analysis to create a "micro-climate" map of a city.

**Required Data/APIs:**
* **NASA POWER API:** For temperature and solar radiation data to identify heat accumulation.
* **NASA Landsat API:** To identify land cover types (e.g., concrete vs. vegetation) and their contribution to heat retention.
* **NASA Airborne Sensor Data:** Potentially use data from airborne sensors like the **Thermal Infrared Radiometer** for detailed temperature mapping.
* **OpenStreetMap API:** To get building and road layouts for urban areas.

### Final Tip: Start with the Data!

While problem statements are a great starting point, a key to success at Space Apps is to **explore the data first**. Spend time browsing the available datasets and APIs. Often, the most innovative solutions are born from a deep understanding of what's possible with the available data, rather than trying to force a problem statement onto a dataset. Happy hacking! üöÄ
